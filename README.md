# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves building a real-time sensor data pipeline system that simulates the data processing infrastructure used in autonomous vehicles like Waymo. The system will ingest streaming sensor data from multiple sources (LiDAR, camera, radar), process it in real-time, and store it efficiently while maintaining data quality and system reliability. This mirrors the large-scale data systems that power perception models in autonomous driving.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a perception engineer, I want to ingest streaming sensor data from multiple sources, so that I can process real-time information for autonomous driving decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensor data arrives from LiDAR sources THEN the system SHALL accept and queue the data within 10ms
2. WHEN sensor data arrives from camera sources THEN the system SHALL accept and queue the data within 10ms  
3. WHEN sensor data arrives from radar sources THEN the system SHALL accept and queue the data within 10ms
4. WHEN multiple sensor streams are active simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle at least 1000 messages per second per sensor type
5. IF a sensor stream becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue processing other available streams without interruption

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to transform and validate incoming sensor data, so that downstream ML models receive clean, consistent data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw sensor data is received THEN the system SHALL validate data format and schema compliance
2. WHEN invalid data is detected THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing valid data
3. WHEN LiDAR point cloud data is processed THEN the system SHALL normalize coordinates to a standard reference frame
4. WHEN camera image data is processed THEN the system SHALL apply timestamp synchronization across all camera feeds
5. WHEN radar data is processed THEN the system SHALL filter out noise below configurable threshold values
6. IF data transformation fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before marking as failed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the pipeline to handle failures gracefully, so that data processing continues reliably even during component failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a processing node fails THEN the system SHALL automatically redistribute workload to healthy nodes
2. WHEN message queue capacity reaches 80% THEN the system SHALL trigger backpressure mechanisms
3. WHEN storage systems become unavailable THEN the system SHALL buffer data in memory up to configured limits
4. WHEN network partitions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain local processing and sync when connectivity resumes
5. IF system resources exceed 90% utilization THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and throttle input rates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want processed sensor data stored efficiently with fast retrieval capabilities, so that I can access historical data for model training and analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processed data is ready for storage THEN the system SHALL write to time-series optimized storage within 100ms
2. WHEN storing LiDAR point clouds THEN the system SHALL use compression to reduce storage size by at least 60%
3. WHEN storing camera images THEN the system SHALL maintain metadata including timestamp, camera ID, and processing version
4. WHEN queried for historical data THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds for time ranges up to 1 hour
5. IF storage write fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 5 attempts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want real-time monitoring and anomaly detection, so that I can identify data quality issues before they impact model performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data flows through the pipeline THEN the system SHALL track throughput metrics in real-time
2. WHEN sensor data patterns deviate from normal ranges THEN the system SHALL generate anomaly alerts within 30 seconds
3. WHEN data latency exceeds acceptable thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger performance alerts
4. WHEN data loss is detected THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging
5. IF anomaly detection models need updates THEN the system SHALL support hot-swapping of detection algorithms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive observability and configuration management, so that I can monitor system health and adjust parameters without downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL expose metrics via Prometheus-compatible endpoints
2. WHEN configuration changes are needed THEN the system SHALL support dynamic reconfiguration without restart
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide distributed tracing across all components
4. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling of processing nodes
5. IF performance tuning is needed THEN the system SHALL expose configurable parameters for batch sizes, timeouts, and resource limits
